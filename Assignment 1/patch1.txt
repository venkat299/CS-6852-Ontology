 ### Domain of Interest
-The domain of interest is **financial instruments** from the perspective of **retail investors**. The ontology aims to model the sentiment associated with various financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc., based on information that retail investors encounter(News headlines, snippets from Annual reports, etc). This information includes company performance, market conditions, and specific aspects of the company's operations or financial health. The goal is to automatically classify financial instruments into either Positive or Negative categories based on the sentiment derived from triplets containing:
