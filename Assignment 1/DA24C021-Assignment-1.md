# Assignment 1: Ontology Design

[TOC]



## Task - 1

## A plain text description of the domain of interest and a list of concrete pieces of knowledge you would like to capture in the domain. 


The domain of interest is **Financial Modeling**. The goal is to develop a basic ontology model which aids 

- **Equity research** by capturing limited details of current and historical information related to given equity instrument in order to assess a security/stock's financial health and also query and filter securities which satisfies certain financial ratio requirements.
- **Portfolio Management** - grouping securities which satisifies certain finacial ratios and market conditions


Developing ontological model will help in framing questions related to equity research in a systematic and concise manner. For example some sample questions are listed below

- Which Stocks are in GrowthStage and has high return in last quarter?
- Which Banking stock gave most return in year YYYY?
- Current year Stock price > Last year stock price?
- List stocks that are eligible to be in X portfolio?

#### Knowledge to be captured:

- **Financial Instrument**

  - Equity - Stock of a **Company** listed in some Market

  - Etf - Collection of stock
  
  - MutualFund - Collection of one or more Equity or Etf
  
  - FundofFund - Collection of one or more Mutual Fund
  
- **Equity**

  An Equity has following properties/relation :

  - Company  (eg. Apple Inc, State Bank of India) - equity belongs to a company
  - Equity metrics
  - Risk metrics
  - Balance sheet metrics
  - Peers : Companies which are operating in same sectors or industry
  
- **Equity Metric**

  - Price : price of a stock
  - Return : return over specified period
  - Dividend

- **Risk Metric**

  - beta
  - volatility
  - sharpe ratio

- **Balance Sheet Metric**

  - **Balance Sheet Ratios**
    - Current : Measures solvency
    - Quick : Measures liquidity
    - Debt-to-Worth : Measures financial risk
    - MarketValuation : MarketCapitalization+Debt
  - **Efficiency Ratios**
    - Sales-To-Assets : Measures the efficiency of Total Assets in generating sales
    - Return On Assets : Measures the efficiency of Total Assets in generating Net Profit
    - Return On Investment : Measures the efficiency of Net Worth in generating Net Profit

- **Market structure**

  - Category (eg. SmallCap, MidCap, LargeCap, etc)
  - MarketIndex : Index/Equity to which the stock is benchmarked against (Nifty, BankNifty)
  - Sector : market classification of stock (Banking , IT , Manafacturing)
  - Stage : Lifecycle stage at which company is in (DevelopmentStage, GrowthStage, SustainabilityStage, ExpansionStage)

- **Time aspects**

  - Year (FY2022, FY2023 etc )
  - Quarter (Q2023-1, Q2023-2, Q2023-3, .....)

- **StockScreener** - collection of equity

  - LowVolatile
  - HighGrowth - Stocks with low pe and high  profit growth 
  - Oversold - Stocks with RSI (Relative Strength Index) < 30



## Task - 2

![role](./role.png)

- **owns** : A company can own other company
  - owns$⊆$Company$×$Company
  - `Trans` (`owns`), (Transitive : If Company A owns Company B and  Company B owns Company C then Company A owns Company B)
  - `Irref` (`owns`),  (Irreflexive : No company can own itself)
  - `Asym` (`owns`),  (Asymmetric : If Company  A owns company B then Company B cannot own Company A)
  - `isOwnedBy`$≡$`owns`$^{-1}$, (Inverse relation , If A owns B then B is owned by A) 
- **has** $\sube$ (Instrument $\times$ Instrument) A instrument can be part of other instrument
  - Transitive : `Trans` (`has`)

![role2](./role2.png)

- **observedIn** : (Metric$\to$ TimePeriod)

#### Axioms

- Company should be a part of some sector

  > Company $⊑∃$ isInSector.Sector

- Company must be in some type of business lifecycle stage

  > Company $⊑ \ =1$ isInStage.BusinessStage

- Holding company is a company which owns another company

> HoldingCompany$≡$Company$⊓∃$owns.Company

- Heirarchial role of Instruments

  - Etf $⊑ ∃$ has.Stock
  - MutualFund $⊑ ∃$ has.Stock $⊔$ $∃$ has.ETF
  - FundofFund $⊑∃$ has.ETF $⊔$ $∃$ has.MutualFund

- Portfolio holds at least one stock:

  > Portfolio $⊑ ∃$ holds.Stock

- A stock must have a price, return, and volatility:

  > Stock $⊑ ∃$ hasPrice.Price $⊓ ∃$ hasReturn.Return $⊓ ∃$ hasVolatility.Volatility

- Price, return, and volatility are observed in specific time periods:

  > Price $⊑ ∃$ observedIn.TimeInterval

  > Return $⊑ ∃$ observedIn.TimeInterval

  > Volatility $⊑ ∃$ observedIn.TimeInterval

- Midcap : companies with a moderate market valuation ranging from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 20,000 crores

  > Midcap $⊑$  Stock ⊓ (hasMarketValuation.( ≥ 5000)) ⊓ (hasMarketValuation.( ≤ 20000))

- Smallcap : company whose market capitalization is less than Rs 5,000 crores are known as small-cap companie

  > Smallcap $⊑$  Stock ⊓ (hasMarketValuation.( < 5000))

- Largecap : company with market caps of ₹20,000 crore or more

  > Largecap $⊑$  Stock ⊓ (hasMarketValuation.( > 20000))

- LowVolatile stocks have volatility lesser than 0.3:

  > LowVolatileStocks $⊑$ Stock $⊓$ (hasVolatility.( $<$ 0.3))

- LowVolatile portfolio holds more than 3 equities each having volatility lesser than 0.3:

  > LowVolatile $⊑ ∃$ hasStock.(LowVolatileStocks)) $⊓$ ($\ge3$ hasStock)

- HighGrowth - Stocks with low pe(<10) and high  profit growth (>40%)

> HighGrowthStocks $⊑$ Stock $⊓$ (hasPE.( $<$ 10) $⊓$ hasProfitGrowth.ProfitGrowth.(>40)) 

* HighGrowth portfolio holds more than 3HighGrowthStocks equities

> HighGrowth $⊑ ∃$ hasStock.(HighGrowthStocks) $⊓$ ($\ge3$ hasStock.Stock)]

- Oversold - Stocks with RSI (Relative Strength Index) < 30

> OversoldStocks $⊑$ Stock $⊓$ (hasRSI.RSI $<30$)

* Company, Stock has always a unique name

  > Company $⊑ (=1$ hasName.Name$)$
  > Stock  $⊑ (=1$ hasName.Name$)$ 

- CompanyName and StockName are disjoint

  > CompanyName $⊓$ StockName $⊑ ⊥$

Design choices 

- Use of Transitive roles : The company can have ownership chain say Company A can own Company B and Company B owns Company C which was captured by transitive role `owns`. Similar transitive role `has` also captures relation like Etf has Stock and Mutual fund can have both Stock and ETFs.
- Concept Disjointness : The company and stock name should be disjoint to represent different entities. Stock is a financial instrument representing the company's business.
- Inverse Role :
  - (Company $⊑∃$isInSector.Sector) A company will definitely belong to a sector but (Sector $⊑∀$has.Company) a sector can have 0 or many companies.
